# Hi 👋 I’m Jisha

I am a Computer Science student focused on **machine learning from first principles**, with a specific research interest in **reasoning capabilities, mathematical logic, and transformer interpretability**.

My approach is dual-track: I build architectures from scratch to understand the math, and I leverage state-of-the-art open weights to push the boundaries of reasoning.

## 🧠 Core Machine Learning & Reasoning

### 🔬 [Nano-Reason](https://github.com/jrajala6?tab=repositories)
**Focus: Reasoning Alignment & Mathematical Logic**
A specialized exploration into reasoning behaviors, building upon **Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct**.

* **Foundation:** Leverages the Qwen2.5-Math architecture to study how small-to-mid-sized models handle complex logical chains.
* **Methodology:** Focuses on optimizing **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** performance and step-by-step verification.
* **Goal:** To understand the limits of reasoning in <2B parameter models and improve logical consistency in mathematical tasks.

### 🤖 [GPT-2 From Scratch](https://github.com/jrajala6/gpt2-from-scratch)
**Focus: Architecture & Training Dynamics**
A ground-up implementation of the GPT-2 architecture (124M) to master the engineering behind LLMs.

* Implemented **Causal Self-Attention**, Multi-Head Attention, and MLP blocks manually.
* Wrote custom training loops and data loading pipelines without high-level trainer abstractions.
* **Why:** To move beyond "import transformers" and understand the raw tensor operations that drive language generation.

### 🧪 [Neural Networks (Zero-to-Hero)](https://github.com/jrajala6/NeuralNetworks)
**Focus: The Mathematical Foundation**
A deep dive into the calculus of AI, based on Andrej Karpathy’s curriculum.

* Built **Micrograd** (backpropagation engine) from scratch.
* Explored loss surfaces, vanishing gradients, and activation function mechanics.
* Bridged the gap between raw Python/Math and PyTorch tensors.

## 🛠️ Systems Engineering Foundation

I believe **strong ML engineers must also be strong systems engineers**. I build low-level systems to ensure I understand the infrastructure that serves my models.

* **HTTP Server (Python)** — Handled raw sockets and request parsing to understand the transport layer.
* **BitTorrent Client** — Implemented peer-to-peer protocols to master distributed data transfer.
* **Redis-like Server** — Built in-memory data structures to understand efficient state management.

## 🎯 Research Interests

* **Neuro-AI Alignment:** Exploring new paradigms to align model architectures with **biological and neurological processes** (e.g., biologically plausible learning rules beyond backprop).
* **Embodied AI & Robotics:** Applying reasoning models to physical control systems to bridge the gap between high-level logic and real-world actuation.
* **Reasoning Priors:** How to induce stronger logic and Chain-of-Thought in smaller parameter spaces.

## 📫 Connect

I am actively looking to collaborate on **reasoning-centric ML** or **robotics** research.
